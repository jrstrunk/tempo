# Tempo

A human-friendly, mockable datetime library!

Only run a task past a certain time of day, calculate the difference beteen times and dates, time long running tasks, parse and format datetimes, and more! Over 400 unit tests, contributions welcome!

Written in almost pure Gleam, Tempo tries to optimize for the same thing the Gleam language does: explicitness over terseness and simplicity over convenience. My hope is to make Tempo feel like the Gleam language and to make it as difficult to write time related bugs as possible!

Supports both the Erlang and JavaScript targets.

## Installation

```sh
gleam add gtempo@6
```

Supports timezones only through the `gtz` package. Add it with:

```sh
gleam add gtz@1
```

#### Parsing and Formatting

```gleam
import tempo
import tempo/datetime

pub fn main() {
  tempo.parse_any("Dec 25, 2024 at 1:00 PM")
  // -> Ok(#(Some(date), Some(time), None))

  tempo.format_local(tempo.ISO8601Milli)
  // -> "2024-12-25T06:04:20.534-04:00"

  datetime.literal("2024-12-25T06:00:00Z")
  |> datetime.format(tempo.Custom("ddd @ h:mm A"))
  // -> "Fri @ 6:00 AM"

  date.parse("03/02/1998", tempo.CustomDate("DD/MM/YYYY"))
  // -> Ok(date.literal("1998-02-03"))
}
```

#### Handling Current System Time

To aviod common pitfalls, the current system time is only returned as a `Instant` type. It is a monotonic type that represents a unique point in time on the host system and is the most complete representation of system time. It can be converted to all other time types if needed, but it should be used as in when possible.

The current system time can also be dealt with by using the `tempo` module functions like below.

```gleam
import gleam/io
import tempo
import tempo/duration
import tempo/time
import tempo/instant

pub fn main() {
  // Timing tasks
  let timer = instant.now()
  long_running_task()
  instant.since(timer)
  // -> duration.minutes(42)

  // Formatting the current system time
  tempo.format_utc(tempo.ISO8601Seconds)
  // -> "2024-12-26T15:04:20Z"

  // Comparing the system time to other times
  let target = datetime.literal("2024-12-26T03:10:00Z")

  case tempo.is_later(than: target) {
    True ->
      io.println(
        "We are late by "
        <> tempo.difference(from: target)
        |> duration.format
      )
    False -> io.println("We are on time!")
  }
  // -> We are late by 54 minutes
}
```

#### Mocking Current System Time

The system time can be frozen at a specific time or set to a specific time and allowed to progress further from there with an optional speedup factor. Setting the time with a speedup factor allows for quick testing of code that would usually run at a slower cadence.

```gleam
import gleam/erlang/process
import tempo
import tempo/mock

pub fn main() {
  // Set the current system time to a specific time and stop it from progressing
  mock.freeze_time(datetime.literal("2024-06-21T13:42:11.314Z"))

  process.sleep(10_000)

  tempo.format_utc(tempo.ISO8601Seconds)
  // -> "2024-06-21T13:42:11Z"

  mock.unfreeze_time()

  tempo.format_utc(tempo.ISO8601Seconds)
  // -> "2025-02-02T08:42:11Z"
}
```

```gleam
import gleam/erlang/process
import tempo
import tempo/mock

pub fn main() {
  // Set the current system time to a specific time, allowing it to
  // continue to progress at x2 the speed of real time.
  mock.set_time(datetime.literal("2024-06-21T00:00:00.00Z"). speedup: 2.0)

  // Sleep for 10 real seconds, but this library will report that 20 seconds
  // have passed.
  process.sleep(10_000)

  tempo.format_utc(tempo.ISO8601Seconds)
  // -> "2024-06-21T00:20:00Z"

  mock.unset_time()
}
```

#### Time Zone Conversion

Time zone conversion is only supported with an external package like `gtz` to provide timezone information.

```gleam
import gtz
import tempo/datetime

pub fn main() {
  let assert Ok(local_tz) = gtz.local_name() |> gtz.timezone

  datetime.from_unix_seconds(1_729_257_776)
  |> datetime.to_timezone(local_tz)
  |> datetime.to_string
  // -> "2024-10-18T14:22:56.000+01:00"

  let assert Ok(tz) = gtz.timezone("America/New_York")

  datetime.literal("2024-01-03T05:30:02.334Z")
  |> datetime.to_timezone(tz)
  |> datetime.to_string
  // -> "2024-01-03T00:30:02.334-05:00"
}
```

#### Iterating Over a Date Range

```gleam
import tempo/date
import tempo/period

pub fn main() {
  date.literal("2024-06-21")
  |> date.as_period(end: date.literal("2024-06-24"))
  |> period.comprising_dates
  // -> [2024-06-21, 2024-06-22, 2024-06-23, 2024-06-24]

  date.literal("2024-06-21")
  |> date.as_period(end: date.literal("2024-07-08"))
  |> period.comprising_months
  // -> [tempo.Jun, tempo.Jul]
}
```

#### Waiting Until a Specific Time of Day

```gleam
import gleam/erlang/process
import tempo/duration
import tempo/time
import tempo/instant

pub fn main() {
  // Sleep until 8:25 if we start before then.
  instant.now()
  |> instant.as_local_time
  |> time.until(time.literal("08:25:00"))
  |> duration.as_milliseconds
  |> process.sleep

  // Now that it is 8:25, do what we need to do.
  "Hello, world!"
}
```

## Time Zone and Leap Second Considerations

This package purposefully **ignores leap seconds** and **will not convert between time zones unless given a timezone provider**. Try to design your application so time zones do not have to be converted between and leap seconds are trivial. More below.

Both time zones and leap seconds require maintaining a manually updated database of location offsets and leap seconds. This burdens any application that uses them to keep their dependencies up to date and burdens the package by either invalidating all previous versions when an update needs to be made or providing hot timezone data updates.

If at all possible, try to design your application so that time zones do not have to be converted between. Client machines should have information about their time zone offset that can be polled and used for current time time zone conversions. This package will allow you to convert between local time and UTC time on the same date as the system date natively.

Since this package ignores leap seconds, historical leap seconds are ignored when doing comparisons and durations. Please keep this in mind when designing your applications. Leap seconds can still be parsed from ISO 8601 strings and will be compared correctly to other times, but will not be preserved when converting to any other time representation (including changing the offset).

When getting the system time, leap second accounting depends on the host's time implementation.

To account for leap seconds with this package, use a separate leap seconds provider package to compare dates (this leap second provider is fictional):

```gleam
import tempo/datetime
import leap_second

pub fn main() {
  datetime.literal("1972-06-30T23:59:59Z")
  |> leap_second.difference(from: datetime.literal("1972-07-01T00:00:00Z"))
  // -> "00:00:02"
}
```
